Godot includes a dedicated 2D renderer and 2D physics engine, as well as
2D-specific features like tilemaps, particles, and animation systems.
This section covers most 2D-specific topics in Godot.

For 2D topics not covered in this section, see also
`doc_2d_skeletons`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`doc_navigation_overview_2d`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. For using
physics in 2D, see `doc_physics_index`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
There is also a step-by-step tutorial on creating a 2D game in
`doc_your_first_2d_game`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
