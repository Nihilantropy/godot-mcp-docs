# Platform-specific

Godot supports both running the editor and exporting projects on several
platforms. Usage of the engine is generally similar across platforms,
but there are some platform-specific considerations, which are covered
in this section.

For platform-specific versions of the editor, see
`doc_using_the_xr_editor`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`doc_using_the_android_editor`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`doc_using_the_web_editor`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. For exporting
to specific platforms, see the `doc_export_index`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} section.
